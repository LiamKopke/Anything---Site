# Team Contract: Course Project

This is an informal contract to make sure that both team members are on the same page ü§ù

## Team: Anything

### Team members

- Jeffrey Bringolf

- Liam Kopke

### Strength & Weaknesses

Jeffrey: I'm decent with HTML & CSS but definitely prefer and am better with JS.

Liam: I've got HTML & CSS nailed down pretty good. JS takes me a bit more time, but i can still dish out results.


### Definition of ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù

Fully functionnal with all criterias met. (Aiming for 100%) - Possibly adding the game for bonus


## Contributions

### Division of work

How will each member contribute to the project?

Jeffrey: ~50%

Liam: ~50%

It's hard to tell exactly how we'll be splitting because there are lot's of sequential steps. But we both agreed to split the work along the way.


## Communication

### Frequency of communication

How often will the team be in touch?

We'll have short meetings on Mondays, Wednesdays and  Saturdays

What is a reasonable delay to reply to messages? Is it the same for weekdays and weekends?

Weekdays during normal hours (10am - 6pm): Preferably within the hour, unless at work.
Weekdays after 6pm: By the end of the night
Weekends: By the end of the day



### Receiving feedback

Each member should provide a sample sentence for how they would like to receive constructive feedback

*(example: a hypothetical situation where you have not completed your work in time or you have not replied to a message in a timely manner).*

- Both: Don't beat around the bush just tell me what I'm doing wrong or haven't done and I'll explain why I think I'm doing it correctly or I'll change the way I'm doing it if you're right.

- Jeffrey - Call/Text me if I don't answer on discord. 514-718-5394
  - "Hey Jeffrey the login system you wrote doesn't work. Could you take a look at it again."
  - "Hey could you please try and answer a bit faster if possible, it makes it pretty difficult to get my work done when I have to wait so long for a response."
- Liam - Call/Text me on my cell if I don't answer on discord. 514-825-07934
  - "Hey Liam, *X* part of the website is not working for me, it would probably be in *Y* (very general location) part of the code you wrote, could you take a look at it."
  - "Hey Liam, I noticed it is taking a long time to communicate. From now on, could you please answer within the agreed upon timeframe"


### In case of conflict

If a team member fails to communicate as described in this contract or does not respond to constructive feedback, what measures should the other teammate take?

- If person A is not answering person B, person B will pick up the slack.
- If there is more work to be done later on, person A will take a larger load.
- If there is no more work to be done later on, there's not much that can be done, the project needed to be finished.
